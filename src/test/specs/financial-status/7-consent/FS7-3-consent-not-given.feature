Feature: Handle the responses from the Barclays Consent API and display the appropriate output page when applicant consent is not granted.

    The Barclays Consent API response will return a consent 'status' (Success, Failure, Invalid, Pending) when invoked.

    The service will display the corresponding output page dependant on the status.

        And caseworker is using the financial status service ui
        And caseworker is on page t<Tier>/application/status/<Applicant>
        And the financial status check is performed with
