Feature: Handle the responses from the Barclays Consent API and display the appropriate output page when applicant consent is not granted.

    The Barclays Consent API response will return a consent 'status' (Success, Failure, Invalid, Pending) when invoked.

    The service will display the corresponding output page dependant on the status.

        Given the api health check response has status 200
        And the api consent response will be PENDING
        And the api threshold response will be t2
        And caseworker is using the financial status service ui
        And the caseworker selects <Tier>
        And <Applicant> applicant type is selected
        And the caseworker selects the Yes, check Barclays radio button
